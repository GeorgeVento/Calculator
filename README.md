## Calculator Web App

This project is a simple, responsive web-based calculator built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All core functionality—UI display, input handling, and calculation logic—is managed through clean front-end code designed for maximum simplicity and portability.

## 🛠️ Technologies

HTML: Structures the calculator layout and input/output elements.
CSS: Provides styling for the calculator interface, buttons, and layout.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, button inputs, display updates, and math evaluations.

## 📦 Content

index.html — The main interface of the calculator, containing the display and buttons.

style.css — Handles the visual styling (uploaded separately by user).

index.js — Contains all JavaScript logic for button clicks, clearing, and performing calculations.

## 🧮 Functionality

The calculator provides all the essential arithmetic features:

## ✔️ Input Handling

Buttons append numbers or operators into the display field. 

## ✔️ Basic Operations

Supports:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (−)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

## ✔️ Calculation

The calculate() function uses JavaScript's evaluation capabilities to compute the result. If an invalid expression is entered, the calculator displays "Error". 

## ✔️ Clear Function

The display can be reset instantly using the Clear/C button.
(Note: Your JS file uses clearDisplay() but your HTML calls ClearDisplay(). These must match.)

## 🚀 Execution Guide

No server environment is required. You can run the calculator directly in your browser.

Steps:

Ensure all project files are in the same folder:

index.html

index.js

style.css

Double-click index.html to open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

Interact with the calculator using your mouse or touchscreen.
